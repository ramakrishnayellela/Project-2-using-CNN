Plant Disease Detection using Computer Vision and Deep Learning

🌱 Project Overview

This project aims to identify plant diseases using computer-assisted aggregation techniques. It leverages Deep Learning (CNNs) to classify plant diseases based on leaf images and recommends suitable pesticides. The model is trained on a dataset containing images of healthy and diseased plant leaves.

🚀 Features

Image-based plant disease classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Custom-trained model (not using pre-trained models)

Deployment-ready using Django for web or mobile integration

Disease diagnosis with pesticide recommendations

User-friendly GUI or web interface for real-time predictions

📂 Dataset

The dataset consists of labeled images of healthy and diseased leaves.

Sources: Publicly available datasets such as PlantVillage.

Image preprocessing includes resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
